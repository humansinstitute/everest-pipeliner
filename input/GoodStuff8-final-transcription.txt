 let's dive in yeah so let me start the back up right okay so there's the elephant  in the room is this is podcast number two for the week so yesterday we spent  an hour and a half in the club town just it was probably the best I think  that's ever been recorded yep of all podcasts ever made not just ours exactly covered it  all solved all the problems and then we played it after so we just check the  file before we listen to it and it was like I don't know too drunk high-pitched  robots you literally couldn't tell what we were saying all gremlin mode yeah so  the artifact I think we had on the last call it was the whole thing was was that  yeah that was was disappointing felt a little bit flat you consider trying to  rush one out yesterday to make sure we hit the usual Wednesday but it was I  think it would have been crap and a bit stilted and like we would have just  tried to replicate I don't replicate what we did and done it badly and like  luckily I've forgotten everything exactly despite the fact it was like the  was the tenacious d song like this is this could be a tribute yeah this isn't  the best podcast but it's a tribute to the best part I love that that's very  good maybe that's the show title the new show title yeah yeah we did have a show  title yesterday that we arrived at which maybe we'll we'll talk about but but I  mean for context I think like we don't really care too much for these episodes  other than we'll have a broad think about like what the theme of the episode  is going to be about I think roughly we'll try to stick to the same theme  that will probably cover it in a different way yeah because it's not prepared at all  so the theme this week was obviously based off of listening to conversation  on the all-in podcast on the weekend and and and maybe like a lot of the discourse  around AI lately has been predominantly kind of doomerist for the most part and  I guess what we wanted to achieve with this week's pod was to kind of explore  perhaps what the net positive tracks might look like from AI and I guess like  the caveat here which I guess we we uncovered yesterday is you kind of do  need to explore the doomer paths a little bit in order to kind of game  theory out how this might play and then you arrive at like what the positives  are gonna be and who it benefits and how you can take advantage of what's of  what's coming so yeah I think that's gonna be the objective again how we kind  of navigate it we'll leave that up to the next hour in a bit and figure it out  yeah well at least we have two two devices going right now for recording so  hopefully worst case you get a slightly shitty recording but it's happened to  everyone right like I remember years ago listening to Tim Ferriss I think he  talks about like losing an episode as well with like his recording equipment  failed and you know he's obviously doing like really long-form with guests as  well so that must have been and with people that don't want to waste their  time exactly for us to talk again is it's just well we're gonna do it anyway  yeah exactly you know so it's actually not a big deal and we'll probably find  other things to talk about anyway I got me I felt a bit flat like literally in  the podcast I was looking at my phone and thinking you know what I should  probably use that as a backup recorder just in case and I was thinking of that  like Tim Ferriss like talking about having like several backups and battery  backups and stuff and I was like yeah now maybe we leave it up to the winds of  fate if it's recorded it's recorded that's so we share it if it's not it's  not we just do another one but that's yeah so welcome welcome welcome to good  stuff now we can get out of the way because we often miss that day when we  get like eight ten minutes in and then just keep going um I think we because we  had good momentum from last week's episode as well but we actually have a  bunch of new it's a new followers as well on on YouTube yep some some  criticism which was constructive that's good there's still a couple of shoutouts  we should do do you want to do those I yeah sorry that's the thing you forget  about these things don't you right so first of all shout out to Sean yes it was  the first first person to send us Satoshi's on fountain app so very it's  curious what that means like podcasting 2.0 is a protocol by which you can then  send Bitcoin as money to the various people we've got an account on fancy  which means if you listen on there you can stream us money like when you listen  show them as the first person so thank you very much short so shout out Sean  and then the second person will be shout out to Chris B who is our biggest donor  yes of the week so far well our backup audio is gonna be in two parts yes just  fucked up so I don't know what was going on there let's just stop it talking to  stuff there we go turn everything off it's a work in voice recording but yeah  we're learning all of the lessons this week about content creation it's good I  mean this is a great egg you know it's just a great proof point that we're not  trying the wrong way we're not editing anything so if you wanted anyway shout  out crispy yes it was our biggest donor of the week so he did ask in his  donation is he the first one like no you weren't but you can be the biggest one  although you know I don't know if someone's gonna gonna pop you to the  post this week so usually it's best to just do an exponentially increasing  donation week after week just to make sure I'd say maybe we need a little  leaderboard pop a leaderboard on the good stuff yeah and we can track this  stuff about all right thank you guys thank you like I guess we also had a  bunch of we did have some feedback we talked about this yeah we did yesterday  maybe we cover it quickly here was I'm just trying to tell us that we should be  using videos yeah and I you know I think you know what people are always like down  on YouTube comments and so you shouldn't read the comments you just follow trolls  it's like you know I know I'll just I'll just give like a nice measured response  to this guy and I reckon I reckon he'll understand it I said now you know the  reason we don't use videos is but yeah in internet anonymity I think is it's  something that we should fight for and I you know believe in that and I believe  in privacy like it's it's pretty not the driving force to why we have this like  little Monkey Island style animation that was that was more that we were  aware that we kind of needed video of some form but we didn't want to over  complicate what we were doing and we wanted to really focus on having a  natural conversation and what we found was whenever we like set up a camera and  pointing that ourselves and we've done this like we've done podcasts together  with on camera we've done podcasts that we did like effectively the early  precursors of this podcast that never went anywhere because we looked at them  afterwards it's just it just it just doesn't work and yeah it felt like the  conversation was stilted like we just didn't we slipped into it have a natural  interview mode a little bit as well which I think was more just the setting  it feels a little bit more like you feel a bit more straitjacketed and you've  got to ask each other questions and it just never felt like what we were trying  to replicate essentially are these conversations we have down at the beach  every week coffee anyway and so you know they're like fireside chats but what a  fireside chat is meant to be not the fireside chat that everyone seems to  want to host which is basically just you know the interview format and we even  tried right we the first one we actually did fire a camera out the back of the  van looking at the sea yeah and we thought all right well people just watch  the ocean like that we're looking at like as this goes on and that'll work  but then it turns out like a bunch of like kids would walk past or they'd be  like somebody like getting changed or like you know pretty scantily clad in  front of me okay well you can't just pull this stuff out on the internet it's  like no that's not cool so like we couldn't really use that video so then  we said let's just generate something and the aesthetic yeah it's a it's a cool  aesthetic but also like probably my first coding project that I started and  finished you know yeah which I guess we'll get into some of this stuff today  but that was kind of cool it was kind of fun to build out as well so all right  well yeah there you go that sounds like let's let's get into it that sounds like  a positive yeah a positive thing has come out of AI like you've learned to  code like yeah apparently yes my sense of timing was completely off apparently  you could have just skipped this but I mean I wouldn't say I've learned to code  I think that's that's maybe pushing it a little bit too too far I'm learning to  code but I guess the context here is that I've attempted to learn to code many  times over the last decade and I've always kind of run into blockers where I  just kind of crash out yeah and I think it's largely a case of we've discussed  this on prior episodes but largely a case of syntax where you know you've  got to navigate the language that you're trying to learn for me it was always  Python just starting there and I don't know it just didn't really necessarily  suit my learning style either and so I just would hit points where I  would rely on discipline to keep going but then that discipline would fail at  some point because I was trying to learn in the abstract and I wasn't actually  trying to build something and I think what's really great about using AI now  is that you can start with a project and you can just try to build something and  you can learn along the way and that's obviously not how everyone is using AI  right I mean I think this whole vibe coding movement exists and that's kind of  not what I'm trying to do I'm trying to be a little bit more proactive with the  projects that I'm I'm building and using cursor as a kind of a tutor mentor and  technical co-founder as well off to the side and I guess yeah maybe I can like  walk through how I'm doing this a little bit but vibe coding I think is like when  I think about vibe coding with essentially just using the agent inside  an IDE like cursor to just you know you give it an idea of what you want to  build and then it will just go off and figure out how to build it and what it  should be and how it functions you don't really pay attention yeah you don't  you don't really worry too much about what it does and I do think that is  fraught with any number of risks and dangers and it's maybe like an outside  in approach to building a product you know where you've got yeah you just start  with the goal and you let it go off and do its own thing and I guess like I'm  trying to do this a little bit differently because my objective is two  fold it's one I just want to build variations of stuff that I've had living  in my head or just ideas that pop into my head on a daily basis so it's kind of  perfect for someone like me and then the other side is like practically using  that as a means to learn what's actually happening under the hood and that  requires a bit of discipline and so I feel like that's enough for me like  some things I'll start you know with no intention of ever going live I'll just  start it and it's the process of having something to build that I can just use  as a way to educate myself and so I think that's more of an inside out  approach maybe if I were to try to distinguish the two a little bit it's  like not strictly vibe coding I'm not writing the code but there's a decision  that I'm making to actually review it and try to understand why that code  exists and then I'll switch to like in cursor or switch to ask and I will then  just ask you know why have you structured the code in this way why does  this file exist like what is the objective could this be cleaned up you  know sometimes I'll just go and ask it to review the code and I'll tell it like  this was written by a June developer just give me a full review of the code  that's been written and any kind of critiques how you'd improve it and then  it will give me a bunch of suggestions and that's quite interesting so but I  think when you're not necessarily trying to build something for an audience for  a market with the view to you know building a startup then it's just all  the gloves are off at that point you can just build an experiment I like the sorry  I just like expression the expression the gloves are off which just means  nothing means absolutely this is a running it this is a running joke for us  I think by the way yeah but yeah I guess so practically what I would do is before  I even dive into into cursor I've probably got a rough idea of what it is  I want to build mm-hmm and I will basically chat to Claude off in a  separate environment and any questions that I might have like I'll try and  stress-test the idea and essentially the aim is to build a roadmap or a PRD that  gives us like a kind of a set a series of steps to go and build this this  product to this project out and then we'll decompose that into like basically  a series of sequential prompts and the prompts will go into cursor to build  parts of the product and like this is very deliberate because if I just start  with a goal and I pop that into cursor as I said it will just go off and build  it the way it sees fit but if I do it this way where we've got like a really  structured approach I'll take the um the markdown of that PRD and I'll pop it in  cursor as well so it can it can kind of review that and return to it as a guide  as well yeah and then yeah it just seems like a more thoroughly planned out build  at that point and so that's kind of what I've been doing. So when you when you  work with Claude then like you I presume this isn't just like one massive  conversation because it gets so confused like the longer you go on like how are  you how are you doing that backwards and forwards? I mean I just set it up as a  project and so when I've had the like a conversation for a particular piece of  the build like to be honest the first conversation does tend to be a bit long  and messy because it's essentially just ideation and it's a bit like having a  technical co-founder that you might bounce an idea around and try and work  out okay what's the preferred architecture that we should employ here  and like what are the things we should look out for and you know what are the  holes in my thinking and yeah that's kind of a very messy conversation but  I'll often take a summary of that and then pop it into the project memory so  that Claude can refer back to it and then yeah having a project set up is  just way easier I think. Yeah so do you keep so in a project obviously you've  got like custom system prompts plus documentation yeah you associate with  that. Exactly. So do you keep like say you plan out a PRD do you then keep that PRD  in the project in the project folder and then that keeps getting  updated yes and so you would manually just like refresh I just have to read I  just update the file yeah yeah okay in that makes sense I can see why that would  help as well with the project structure because it is quite annoying to keep  resetting the context yeah like every time you start a conversation like this  I think the other thing that I'll do in cursor a lot is actually just like I'll  switch down the model to some at 3.5 when I'm just trying to like finesse a  particular feature or make a very specific change I find that's very good  at doing that whereas like when I'm starting out and I've got more of a  blank canvas it's good having some at 4 because yeah it'll populate a little bit  more fluidly and then I'll go okay that's not quite what I expected let me  just hone in on like you know a particular feature but I'll drop the  model down to 3.5 and then just refine that make sure it works and then move on  to the next one yeah and that's kind of where I won't involve Claude as the kind  of standalone I'll just kind of push forward with cursor and then up but what  I will do is I'll take that the kind of process summary that cursor will give  you once it's done something and I'll pop that back into Claude so it's got  some context of the things that we've been doing yeah it's almost just like a  running record of everything we've been been up to yeah it's kind of not  dissimilar to how you might work with a team of people mm-hmm and I think that's  kind of maybe the case like don't try to speed run it too much I think if I mean  if you're a very good developer then maybe you might just be like okay I kind  of have a pretty good idea what's in here I'm just gonna let it do its own thing  there's definitely an issue which is that like you can you can assign it code  and you can let it go I like but even if it's making like one or two changes like  on it or a couple of files or even one fuck is it it does it so quick you  literally can't see what it's doing it like you see it right you write the  changes and then the files updated and you just like I don't know what you did  that so unless it like produces a diff that you can look at every time it's it's  hard to keep track and keep tabs on it so the way I mean the way I've been I  mean just to like just maybe just type back to like where we started like I  think one of the interesting thing here is right we've got you as like a new  to coding is now developed a skill whereby you can manage a team of coders  like you know and it just happens to be that that team of coders is no longer a  team of people it's a team of AI agents and therefore you found a way to control  this that you're happy with that you can make slow and steady progress towards a  goal yeah and that's gonna unlock all sorts of different things for you  personally and like I've I've had very similar I think it's worth dwelling on  the tools a little bit because yeah again this is one area where people keep  asking is like oh but what tools are you doing how are you doing how are you  organizing it it's like yeah okay that's practical I guess we should say some of  that stuff for me it's the principles I follow almost exactly the same and a lot  of this was like what I was developing with stack work previously around the  hive process which was like how do you what does product management look like  in a world of AI like it is a different world there are different challenges by  what does it look like how should we organize it is it an agile model is it a  waterfall model is it something new and that was the concept of hype was kind of  like what is that that process and I think the best description or like  throwaway sentence that I've got for it is it's like super fast waterfall which  is a lot of waterfall was about thinking up front and defining the problem in the  statement and the design so that it was then easier to implement because it was  very expensive to implement and then test yeah agile was all about saying  look it's so easy to implement and test this stuff that we don't need to do that  anymore it's probably quicker to just build it and then see what you're doing  and you would kind of think that natively that's where it would go with  AI's but I think what's maybe this is like a temporal thing but I think right  now the AI's are brilliant if you give them like a structured framework of what  to build similar to going through a waterfall process and they're so fast at  going through that process that you actually you can do like the full design  think through development cycle to test yeah in minutes yeah and so it's worth  doing the upfront work to get a good result out of them whereas I would say  the vibe coding approach is more that agile like just if you don't care about  the quality so much then just let it go and don't worry about it but you might  find it hard to maintain you might have to throw it all away later it's fine but  if you just if you step back slightly and put in planning effort and this  planning effort can also be as you like talked about here right like you can  also use AI tools to make your planning better like the deep research mode in  open AI and I tried it out yesterday as a Claude have just released one as well  in their paid product I saw I don't know if it's available to everybody okay cool  yeah it works like it works pretty good I had it designing me some timber wood  doors yeah it was yeah it's it's it's amazing like going away and doing a lot  of the prep work for you to give you something that you can then edit into  what you want yeah sort of things like these are great great tools and so you  can so you can use tools like this to accelerate your own design to get  through this waterfall waterfall process in a very quick almost quite agile way  it's just like saying but it is worth putting the time in to design the thing  prior to then letting the code get written and then the the controls that I  wrap around that are very again very similar to what I would do in a team  right which is that I don't I don't need to see every line of code that a  developer writes as they're writing it like what I'm interested in is like keep  writing this until it works so as in until the unit test has passed or meet  the specification that I've set out make sure that's there and then provide me  that particular code change as like a PR and a diff that I can then check I can  check in an environment yeah and so like whilst I can't keep up with an AI agent  that writes some code realizes it's made a mistake writes it again writes it  again writes it again writes it again the unit test that pass right okay now I'm  done and now I've got something that I can do if that if that results in a in a  single PR at the end of it then I don't need to see all of those iterations I  can just look at the patch file and say okay I see yeah I see what you've done  here that makes sense all right I can merge that back into the base so really  I'm just going through like controlled feature branches lots of iteration that  just runs but because it's not on main branch I don't really care too much  about whether it works or not and you can like at some point I'd like to  experiment with having like multiple versions of this run yeah in parallel and  then just choosing the one that gives me the best result yeah it's like go I I  think this is like where Pablo's going with his 10x tools and various things  but like that's I'm just really curious see what he really says but I don't know  enough yet to talk about it all this stuff happens in natural language you're  literally doing this in English I think that's the key right I mean the thing  I've been really conscious of here is like not abdicating my thoughts the way  I think today you know like yeah I think it's really easy to just like set a  direction just let it go off and do its own thing but I feel like it has to be  more of an extension of my own hands yeah yeah I mean you've got to be a bit  selfish right because it's like I can do that but then I don't learn exactly and  like it's better if I'm I if I'm like 20% better at telling it what to do then  I'm gonna get a better result yeah so I may as well learn as I go along  completely yeah I mean it's I wouldn't say I don't stick necessarily to the  natural language like I will if you like the bits that I would care about are  gonna be like the like the object definitions in the data so like what  what's the data how is it structured how does it move in between these different  things I won't take the time to make sure that I'm addressing everything at  exactly the right level and checking all my syntax I was like look I want this  object and I want this object like these are the bits that are getting passed  around and this is your interface from here to here and then that just makes it  nice and like loosely coupled so it's easier to make a change over here without  breaking something over here and having those tests in place so I'm I mean I'm  pretty happy with the sort of except for where I just make decisions I'm like you  know what I think I've done this wrong yeah I get and I feel like I'm like  prototyping stuff and starting it again but it's so much it's so quick but you  learn lessons every time yeah so what's so let's what's the what's the positive  here then like maybe we get into that because that's yeah well what I would say  is just before I do just to round out our last point what I found myself doing  really early on when I first got into this was just letting the agent go off  and write code for a couple of minutes you know and I'm not paying attention to  what it's doing and I would fill that time doing something else because we're  human right yep I'm not just gonna sit and watch so I'll open another browser  and I'll have Twitter going and I'll be like seeing what someone's written and  and then I'll come back to it be like cool it's asking me for something like  let me come back to it and check in and you know and that is more like vibe  coding yeah I realize like oh actually this is a discipline right you need to  sit and focus with this thing like if if the if the intention here is for me to  learn but also ultimately to build tools that serve me then yeah I need to be  intentional about it and I can use this as a this is permissionless learning  which we talked about in a previous episode so it was almost like you're  doing a bit of context switching there as well you're like okay it's doing its  own thing let me just go off and do something else. I literally had it  coding in the back of the van with the Starlink on whilst I was driving places  like that opens quite regularly it's like I'll just set this off give it  some guardrails and again because I've got those controls around like look you  can do whatever you want on this branch like you can't fuck anything up but I'm  only gonna let it in if it meets the requirements that I've set out and I can  understand the code at the end of it and it's yeah but that's the key right  because you don't want to just abdicate everything to the agent and so for me  being able to interrogate the code that it's written like you know I don't have  the experience to sit back and go okay that code should not be written in that  way so I'll use agents to figure that out for me and I'll go right review this  now tell me what is actually happening why is it written this way is this up  and sometimes Claude will come back and go this is really well written this is  exactly what it needs to be and then other times it will come back and be  like it maybe should be doing XYZ and then I can take that as a prompt so I'll  get Claude to give me a prompt for how to improve it in cursor and I'll feed  that back to the agent in cursor and I just find that process to be really good  like I'm at the center of that still yeah but I'm doing that deliberately to  to learn I think it yeah I think the difference is that you're trying to  learn yeah not you're not necessarily trying to like build with the highest  velocity like I've been quite interested in like how do you do this like how do  you replace like a development team like this and is it even feasible like and I  really do think we're basically there a low level and now it's like I don't see  why it wouldn't get better and I don't see why we're not gonna get better  context for the LLMs like that's something I think we could probably talk  about of our guests next week it comes on it'll be cool yep but yeah I think like  in terms of yeah for learning you need to be like the point is not learning right  yeah if you just it's also fun yeah it's not learning yeah it's also like I think  what you want when you're learning as well is like feedback loops that  demonstrate progress like that you're making progress and I think that is like  such a big unlock for me as well like on the week like I mean my problem is like  I'll have so many harebrained ideas and I'm like cool let me try building this  let me try building that and I get distracted and it's like you know that  that's almost the biggest risk for me but it doesn't matter for me because as I  said I'm not actually trying to publish any of this stuff it's just a learning  exercise like on the weekend you know I just got completely sidetracked because  I was like oh I wonder how hard it is to build a kind of a platformer game where  I can just like insert a character sprite that looks like me because I just  thought how cool would it be to put myself into like a Mario style like  platformer game where I can jump around and harvest sats and avoid little enemy  sprites that look like Janet Yellen so that's what I did and I was like this is  kind of cool I it really didn't take that long yeah to build out and yeah it  was just so rewarding because you can just see the result and you can play it  and it's kind of fun and you're like oh wow I just did that in you know a couple  of hours hmm and that's like a whole different like area of architecture as  well that I probably wouldn't have come across yeah natively either so and it's  so much easier to learn it by doing it right exactly but it doesn't it almost  doesn't matter like what the project is what the idea is what the pain point is  that you've got if there's like a thing because that you would like to see Bill  yeah and then you build it you will learn so much more like try and learn  some of these concepts in the abstract like because you'll you'll build like I  mean I was saying to this when we're grabbing coffee right there there's  times I go you know I'm I'm fairly certain I've built this wrong yeah I'll  again I will take myself into out of the idea into like some other environment  the LMs where I can talk about what I was doing so I can get almost unbiased  opinions about like well how would you build this sort of stuff yeah like this  would you do like this does this exist is there a thing where I can make it do  something like this and it goes oh yeah that's that's called this you're like oh  all right I didn't know that was a thing so I never prompted it to do that  therefore it never did so and you go all right well next time I build this I'll  just build it better with this concept in mind so and that that makes us by what  you said a minute ago was around hairbrained ideas and I think this is  like I listen this is the guts of most of the positives not that we have more  hairbrained ideas but it feels like the ability to test ideas and to start new  things and to deliver like productive businesses products services whatever it  is is just dropped massively with this like the main the main thing we do as  humans is use intelligence and we're saying like yeah there's like a there's  a what seems like a big doomerie like negative here which is that we've just  commoditized intelligence so everybody's gonna have access to to build it right  to use it and to build it into their processes and potentially replace people  in seats that have previously done those jobs and that sounds like super scary  but the flip side of that is that you are also a person that can use this and  can build whatever it is that you desire and that you want or any ideas that  you've had like the cost of you like having agency and taking action in the  world has just dropped precipitously and that is in general good for society yes  you know the the cheaper we make it to make make things to you know improve our  lives improve like you know build capital goods build new product services  like we we make life better for everybody on the whole and we make  everything cheaper it's just that potentially the job you used to have  might not exist anymore but the job that you could have that you most want that  most you know like meet your expression like what you see and want in the world  like you can go and do that and you can go and do that now at a much lower cost  than you could have done it previously there's not easy but like I think that's  the major positive is that you know you like to go back to example we were just  talking about right like you didn't know how to code these things previously  you've you've always been interested you've always worked in tech you've  always had technology teams but you always needed somebody else right you  were always going to get a technical co-founder you were always going higher  developers and it just makes the cost of experimentation so high all of a sudden  like your hairbrained scheme to test it out might cost you 25 grand that's  something is like oh that's um that's a hit well there's also an opportunity cost  yeah because you know what else could you be doing with that time you can only  fire off so many arrows when you're experimenting as well if they all take  six months to a year to test out properly as well you know that's that's  the other the other the other side of it so I mean yeah if you think about like  what this looked like I don't know five years ago ten years ago you know as I  said you need the team you need the technical co-founder especially if you  were non-technical you need money so you'd go to investors you try to pitch  them on your idea you'd hopefully have some sort of working prototype and if it  was already you know if it already had customers and all the better but then  you need to get an office you have to staff that with a bunch of people as  well build out the team I don't know you know like a new personal runway you'd  want some cash on the bank because again you've got that opportunity cost  problem yeah I mean it does just feel like this is a bit of a golden age for  entrepreneurship we've kind of talked about this before a little bit but yeah  now I think my personal approach is to not think so much about building for  markets don't think about the size of the opportunity and don't think about you  know trying to focus group out your idea think about what features everyone else  wants just build for an audience of one which is you that's what I'm doing I  kind of feel like if I can build tools that are valuable that give me leverage  then there are gonna be similar people out there like me that would also  benefit from it but only if I'm getting a benefit from it so I kind of feel like  this is kind of maybe the the 180 of most one most startup advice that's come  out in the last like couple of decades but you know it kind of becomes if you  think about it right like it's the return on investor capital like profile  is different here because the investor capital is so much less the return  doesn't need to be as big so you know if you're if it's a startup world and you're  raising 21 million dollars you need to think like what what's the the business  that that underpins and like what's the exit that people are looking for and  like how do you scale it up to that level then you really do need a very  large audience of people that are buying your product to do it and therefore  that's why you would do focus groups and you would build for like general needs  that people have whereas if your invested capital is you know six months  of your own time then you know you can place whatever value you want on that  but it's it's a lot less generally than 21. 6 months of your own time while  you're also testing out you know and you're learning and you're having fun  yeah you know it's high momentum good energy like it's just like you're all in  on one idea yes six months cuz you had to be and now it's like I think that's  driving yeah evidently yeah I haven't tried that yet but give me time um but  yeah you can be testing out half a dozen concurrently yeah my goal is to be able to  do stuff while I'm having a walk that's why I want to be able to go on like a  three-hour walk out I'll do some of the design work on a walk but yeah it's like  you don't quite get the the feedback that you need you kind of need to stop  and look at stuff true so I'm on the light generally the walk-in desk if need  be yeah this is all like I and we kind of touched on this yesterday but this is  like Nival's permissionless leverage right where he's talked about like in  the past you have these like traditional forms of leverage largely I think it was  labor leverage and capital so labor is like you've got to go and convince a  bunch of people to come and work for you on your idea and that's like the  essentially the early part of the process where you're building the team  and then the capital leverages you need to go and get the money from investors  in order to build and the permissionless leverage in the past has been it's like  code media and you know products that you can you can build once and they have  like relatively low costs of replication and yeah I think this is like the big  unlock for AI you know if you're remotely entrepreneurial you just have  ideas that you want to that you want to test you know the barrier has just dropped  even even further like you know it's always been permissionless if you think  about it to some degree yeah it's just those barriers and the opportunity cost  has always been there and yeah I just think those have collapsed and that is  incredible I mean for me it's so energizing because I can have an idea in  the morning when I'm in the shower I can walk out and just start like planning it  out with with Claude and I'll just be like hey is this the worst idea in the  world and the first time it responds to me it'll be like no this is a wonderful  idea and I'm like okay hang on like I want you to think through it you don't  have to appease me and then it'll come back with a few different ideas and you  know eventually there's this like it'll take the stream of consciousness and  we'll turn it into a plan and I just think that is yeah radically  permissionless like you can literally get to a working prototype of something  in in hours yeah I mean and again like that just plays into this idea that you  can you can make new things that people are gonna want yeah I was thinking about  like as you said we talked about that a little bit yesterday and what was the  finest podcast that of all time made obviously this one's just a tribute but  it did like I was thinking about it I thought well because a lot of what he  says is about big big big like right like it's like you've got all this  leverage so you can do something you can make it big and you can have this this  data center is basically an army of robots that you can instruct through  code and stuff yeah it's about you get so much access like my I feel like  there's been a maybe a constraint on supply of people that could take  advantage of that and therefore what you got was like a narrowing down into some  people could do it and got very big and other people couldn't do it and couldn't  compete and I think what you're about to do is you're gonna have it's gonna  be it's gonna become very cheap and easy and accessible for other people to take  advantage of this so you can take advantage of it by becoming much better  at your media you can take back become much better at coding and we're gonna  see a massive supply in the people that have access to this permissionless  leverage yes and therefore I think it's gonna move away from it's not that  because you've got this leverage you get to be big I think it's gonna become  because you've got this leverage like the bit that remains is that it's cheap  and you can execute on stuff hmm quickly for yourself yeah and then the sort of  payoff model for that is not that you then dominate the world it's that it's  gonna be more in line with like a kind of Kevin Kelly thousand yeah and as you  said like then it should it kind of changes like your personal model yeah  for like what would you want to focus on like do I want to focus on using this  permissionless leverage to build the biggest thing for the biggest audience  that I possibly could because I can or do I focus on building something that I  really want for me knowing that I now have this these tools this permissionless  leverage tools to create the media to create the app to create the code that I  need to then engage with those yeah one to ten thousand people that might really  really appreciate this exactly how I've done it as opposed to the next version  because I think you'll see like way more stuff coming to the market that's true  way more competition which is really the guts of the value trend that's right I  think the other way we denigrate this sometimes is we we just assume that it's  all just gonna be AI slop right like that is I think what's interesting about  democratizing this is you're gonna get people who otherwise wouldn't have built  something in the past entering spaces and they have you know what I would have  said in the past is like unique domain expertise but now I would say it's just  collective experience or wisdom in a certain area and you don't necessarily  need the like like for example let's just say you've got a teacher has worked  for 25 years in the classroom they've essentially got their own methodology  and they you know shoot the lights out their kids have like really high rates  of learning or how the gloves are off yeah gloves are off oh maybe that applies  to boxing I think so gloves off like that would be that's different so maybe  it is a saying yeah I think it is saying we just we just use it out of context  yeah but you know what I mean so okay so let's just say there's a teacher they've  got like this collective experience their own teaching methodology that is  maybe a hybrid of a bunch of different others you know in the past if someone  wanted to build an edtech they're probably a bunch of programmers that you  know everyone's got an opinion on on education yeah an education advice yeah  I mean I'd say the knowing that you you know obviously you've got an edtech yeah and  and I was neither neither a teacher nor a developer there you go I like that well  but you know you'd be still dependent on the technical co-founder there you know  how how well can you communicate this unique methodology that you've got that  is delivering results for 30 kids every year and go and take that build  something out that essentially can go and help it's probably more innate than  prescribed at this point like a lot of the people that do this stuff well kind  of do it well because it's how they do it more than have necessarily sat back  and gone why do I do this yeah you know like that's that's a bit rare that's  right yeah but on the size thing I think that's like you know that's something we  talked about yesterday as well I can't quite remember the exact quote would I  was I think I was telling you like I was listening to a podcast maybe last week  from the two founders of Andreessen Horowitz and that one of them made this  comment you know they were talking about like like as in it was Andreessen or  Horowitz one or the other yeah they're both very similar looking and I can't  quite remember who said who said this but yeah they were essentially trying to  make this point that like when they were talking about the founding of Andreessen  Horowitz that they were essentially stating that it was just as hard to start  like a small boutique thing that kind of has they said means nothing in the world  which I kind of immediately took issue with yeah and then build that you know  in light or build something that's going to be this like I think they called it a  world-dominating monster so it's like essentially the same amount of work so  you may as well do the latter and I just like fundamentally think it's bullshit  you know like I mean I've tried both to be well I've done both you know like I  built small businesses you build a world-beating monster I haven't done that  I tried but also I don't really care to which is the other thing I think there's  like this embedded premise here that like somehow small equals meaningless  and I think that is just bullshit as well like the only people here this  really serves is venture capitalists this is like a classic case of mongers  like show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome you know like this this  is like them talking their book oh yeah but I think it's just bullshit because  like they can flake scale with significance and I just don't think that  really matters and this is where I think this Golden Age is like really appealing  because it's like you don't need to you don't need to go and build this like  multi-billion dollar company for it to be really valuable it's going to be  valuable to the people who find it valuable but because we've just  collapsed all of the costs of going and starting this like yeah it doesn't matter  you don't need the venture returns anymore you don't need to signal all of  the kind of the growth now like you don't need to go and hire hundreds of  people which I always kind of found a bit ironic and big tech you know it's  like the technology is meant to be deflationary and so what we're gonna do  is we're gonna go and hire like tens of thousands of people to push this product  out yeah to enterprises that also have tens of thousands of people but like  really that's also just signaling growth and then that helps VCs to go hey look  our portfolio company is growing and then they can go and raise another  fund and I just I don't see this like what the what the value of like scale  and significance needs to be here like you can certainly build a bunch of small  things that just work really well there's a guy on Twitter I've forgotten his name  he's got his portfolio of small bets and I've always really loved that that idea  that I've forgotten his name he's like ex-amazon I think and yeah so anyway I  just I saw that podcast and I was just like what the fuck are you guys talking  about this is maybe it was true in the early 2000s I just don't think it I just  don't think it is yeah so I think what we're saying then is that there's a  massive unlock here with AI that we we drop the cost of experimentation and  starting businesses and things that you love so this is the flip side of AI is a  productivity marvel and therefore for owners of businesses it's great because  they can reduce their costs unfortunately reducing costs tends to  mean that people lose jobs but the great side of that is that like the it's never  been easier than ever has been before to learn skills and start businesses yeah  so the outcome of which would be more productive business inside society with  more people doing more things and then I guess if you took like a kind of Austrian  economics economics sort of view of this you would say well human wants and needs  are infinite like we we don't necessarily know what we're missing at the moment  but we always seem to find something that's not inherently perfect and then  desire that thing over what we've got now in the way that like I'm sure if  Henry VIII could come to the modern world and just be like a random pleb  you'd be like oh my god yeah you've got one of these like mechanical things that  can take you everywhere and like what I can just I have like indoor plumbing and  I've got food on demand and from anywhere in the world and I have all  these things and I watch like anything and I've got a magic box I can talk to  it's all right they just be like this is amazing and I've had it so good I think  they'll be just more human desires in the future but then to do those things  requires people to be putting in time and effort identifying the needs and  then building out the needs and I think the bit the humans seem it's almost like  the last thing that remains to me is that humans are the ones that  experience the thing not the AI the AI is a kind of is very much a doing  component and it can do stuff like test ideas and then like read feedback and  data things like this it's not that it couldn't take action in the world but as  far as I'm aware it kind of doesn't have this qualia like there's no yeah it's  not a thing to be what it means to be an AI well famous essay can't live your  life for you yeah and so maybe the thing that humans do is that they are like the  spirit it that experiences the world the physical world that we're in and then  figures out all right well how would I improve my current lot and like the you  know there's an end goal here where humans become the experiences like the  conscious experiences and observers of what the AI builds yeah and then you  lead those things but what that would look like is in the early stage  particularly maybe in the later stage is a bunch of people figuring out things  that can be improved and then improving them by forming you know companies  organisations different processes to improve on that thing and then trading  amongst themselves so they could figure out who does it best so we'd have lots  of companies I feel like yes I feel like there's like two really interesting  branches we could try we should talk like briefly at some point about the  builder AI thing okay like that was funny I feel like yeah I feel like you've  kind of touched on like two interesting like divergent pathways we could go down  here which one we should get on both I think one is like this kind of world of  abundance and then the other is almost describing like a bit of a like rerun of  the Renaissance here potentially but like just to round out the business  building like I think the other side of this permissionless leverage piece is  that okay you could build small businesses which is great and I think  for us personally that was part of the mission when when we've started is still  part of the mission we want to see more durable small business in our in our  community in our local community so you know I think there's maybe a bit of a  barrier here mentally as well for a lot of people to not get started because  they feel like if they're gonna build something it has to be big and I would  just say like just rethink that a little bit like it doesn't necessarily need to  be a world-beating startup where you're going out and raising 21 million dollars  to go and build the thing you know so I think that's that's a part of where the  permissionless leverage bit kicks in for me and then the other side of that is if  you do want to build something that's really big I just think it's gotten so  much easier to do that and we've got plenty of examples of companies now that  if you just look at their their user acquisition rates like you know it's  just insane how quickly they're able to harvest up new users relative to you  know companies from 10 years ago and so my like big things start small that's  right it's same start point anyway well I think the motivation is personal like  it's probably like for me the motivation isn't necessarily to go and become a  multi-billionaire so that's my animus it's probably wrong for me to project  that animus on to other people if if you want to build something with the veto  going and becoming a multi-billionaire that's on you that's fine I'm not here  to tell you that that's wrong I'm just suggesting that either way I think the  barriers to just starting it just so low now and yeah if you are intentional about  it you can just do things so I would say that any of the billionaires I have met  seem like that's more of a burden yeah I mean yeah my my my sentiment exactly  but yeah each to their own but I think like yeah you touched on the world of  abundance bit which I think was interesting because it's something that  we commented on following like the all-in podcast from the weekend because  I think this is kind of the view that Friedberg took in the pod which was  quite interesting and yeah I mean it like I think the parallel there is to  like the Industrial Revolution you know prior to the Industrial Revolution like  goods were you know relatively scarce they were artisanal and so therefore  we're like obviously quite expensive but then when you could just start mass  producing this stuff in a factory obviously that collapsed the prices of  those goods there were plentiful and so more and more people could go and go and  own them and so in that way you know you had this big like deflationary force and  I think we're seeing that with with AI potentially although right now it feels  like the cost of everything is going up but yeah I think so that I think that  was like an interesting dimension as well and maybe this like world of  abundance is obviously like a big net benefit for everybody it'd probably be  the the main the obvious benefit I think if it plays out that most people would  get to it Sharon yeah it's I think the only question that remains and I know  this is we spent a lot more time on this one yesterday was just like how do you  get there personally and then oh yeah what does it you know what are the risks  because there is and I quite like like where we're going today this is this  actually feels like way more positive yeah well yesterday was the finest  podcast I've ever recorded this is just a tribute but it's I think it's it's fair  to say that like this is a productivity marvel potentially yeah the way to take  advantage of that is to be productive which means to identify opportunities to  make things better and then leverage these tools to make them better and to  do it in a way where you don't necessarily need to grow a massive  business like build it process first human at the edge should be keep talking  about yes and then use use the tools take a process it's definitely like the  revitalization of like lean six sigma principles and yeah this is going to  become hugely important in my how we actually design and deliver these  products going forwards the observation there I think that's important is that  like world of abundance won't just create itself necessarily because the  incumbents won't have any like incentive to go and drop the prices of goods they're  just gonna capture harvest up the increase March and this is like kind of  playing out in the value trap and so it is incumbent upon people to maybe  incumbents are on word to use that it's dependent on people starting new  businesses the new entrance will come in they're going to take advantage of that  technology natively from day one that's where the price will start to drop well  this is the point of the value trap right like it's this is how the only  reason we're so confident about it is because there's quite large financial  incentives attached to it you go like right there's a big enough financial  incentive for somebody to to do this to create the company that then has the  massive margin but in doing that everybody that was displaced now knows  that trick there's no secret here it's not like somebody's doing something  that's patented that can't be replicated this can all be replicated you can all  be then there's not necessarily a technical mode there's no secrets behind  it it's just it's just something that requires people to do stuff and you  become way more motivated like in looking at new ways to work and earn a  living when you lose your job like if you've got a comfortable job like unless  you're like me or you just like kind of rebel against these things when you have  them like then it's people will suddenly become motivated to put these things  into action and then that's the competition that then chips away at that  margin over time is why it falls over that three to five year period not  necessarily in the initial few years when there's just huge opportunities on  the table yeah and you know what I think that's like an important point here this  is like us talking our book to some degree but it is important to point out  that we are naturally rebelling against that structured working environment  because that's just how we are we've not particularly thrived in them and so for  me to sit there and go do you know what there is a better way of doing this is  really just me going yeah that suits me and there are a lot of people who I  think would who naturally benefit from that more structured environment and  maybe wouldn't necessarily like to see that disappear but I guess the point I  would make is I think the way we work will change and who used to say we need  to work 40 hours a week to get the same amount of output maybe you just fill it  with more interesting pursuits and that's great hmm maybe companies demand  more of you or maybe your role just completely changes and that's also fine  but I think that's just worth pointing out is that you know we haven't  necessarily bought into that as a system that works for us yeah I mean it's like  I guess it's more in an emotional thriving yeah sense right I'm sure I  could have lived in that world I've come here it kind of reasonably happy and  content with what I was doing and you know I was doing pretty well out of it  but I did just feel like I was a massive slave I didn't like that so if I was  happy with the the slavey feeling then I might have stuck with it but it was nice  to have the money yeah but I mean I think this is and that I quote unquote  certainty yeah I think that certainly doesn't exist and I think this that  becomes more and more obvious now but yeah and we kind of touched on that  yesterday there are certain structures that keep you locked into those  requirements I mean the mortgage is the big one the 30 year debt instrument is  really like challenging because I think it's almost impossible to take like a  long-term view on this stuff you know generationally I think the stuff hasn't  changed that much in the past you could bank on having a career for 30 years at  least and it probably probably wasn't gonna be upended too decisively  whereas now I think you know locking yourself into the 30 year mortgage is  uncomfortable when you don't know what the next three to five years are gonna  look like I think that's it right this is I mean I've done a few podcasts with  various usually in the Bitcoin space where I've talked to people and we  talked about like the impacts of AI and the bit like when it comes into the like  oh so it's all positive then there's no doomer it's been a lot of this is the  like the the main risk is a personal risk yeah that people take on and it's  it's whether you want to lock a very large 30 year long debt in on the  assumption that your salary always goes up your salary is always there and the  the cost of everything keeps going up with inflation and I I just I don't think  that's a wise bet anymore I think that it was for like the 1980s through to the  2020s you had a 40 year period where broadly speaking interest rates only ever  trended down towards zero obviously famously at the end of like 2020 they you  went into zero interest negative interest rate policy in various places  around the world and then in 2021 everything broke and broadly speaking  again like interest rates have only ever been going up for the past four years  and like they they cool off a bit but the trend is seems like it's switched  and we've entered a new secular interest rate period of like interest rates are  likely to get higher just means the cost of that debt instead of falling over  time now increases over time yeah which means it's even more important for your  salary to continually go up over time and or for you to always have a  consistent salary and so this is just places this this risk on people when you  say like well you know jobs could disappear even if jobs don't disappear  it's likely that there's more competition for jobs like most of that  points to nominally less money in your pocket in terms of salary in a world  where like you know the money that you need to service that debt is likely to  go up yes over a long period and you can say like oh well houses are scarce and  therefore they'll go up over time well maybe but you generally don't take on a  mortgage for 30 years in order to flip the house you do it to live in it and the  moment that you can't service the debt is the moment that you realize that the  house was never yours in the first place I'm just borrowing it from the bank and  they will just take it back and then you will now be bankrupted and I that is the  major risk to me is that a lot of I think a lot of people's jobs are designed  around how do I service the debt for the life that I'm living yeah and it's by  taking on all of that debt that you that is the great undoer yeah I wouldn't be  surprised to see this massage from a couple of different directions like a  one-hand I reckon the banks would probably shift to 40 50-year mortgages  to try and like even this stuff out and get people on to interestingly pay the  year mortgage that think about it and you're still paying 80 you're not  supposed to be retired like well you would think so but the average age of  your mortgage now has gone up you know a lot of people who are buying a house the  average age is pushing into the late 40s and 50 I mean we're obviously in  Australia so this is maybe more Australian centric conversation but and  then the other side of that is if you do start getting that messy transition with  a lot of job loss you know government has already shown that it's prepared to  go and you know create programs like JobKeeper to just keep the money flowing  so it wouldn't surprise me if you started to get essentially government  subsidized mortgages if it gets really bad and yeah man at that point you know  like all roads lead to more money printing I don't know I feel like these  are not good outcomes and so I for me it's like I don't necessarily want to be  tied to that uncertainty that feels like the more risky play to go dive into  property we don't even have good oversight and what's happening in the  next kind of couple of years yeah if it was if if everybody if I felt that  everybody in the world was well capitalized with money in the bank and  could exit their job and spend like with a year's runway that they can then try  new things out yeah I'd be fairly happy that this whole AI transition is only  good news yeah if most people in the world are like heavily levered in debt  and don't have any personal runway and the idea of like not being paid for a  year is just a yeah like catastrophic like catastrophic then that that's the  piece that worries me and I think I would agree that do you know there's  another piece to this as well that I think it's not even AI technology  related it's what happens when like you get a decent percentage of boomers all  looking to downsize around the same time and I reckon there's probably a point in  the next five years where that start or maybe it's like a little bit longer I'm  not sure but I reckon there's a point where that just starts to happen all  around the same time where they just start to sell and because the other thing  is like you probably get to retirement age you maybe want to take some of that  home equity and be able to live off of it a little bit as well and you know and  it's like what kind of effect does that have as well if that all tends to happen  around the same time well the the interesting thing is like if I would say  maybe the the trigger for that would be something along the lines of bonds yeah  so boomers like I thinking of well the term for kangaroo there six white boomers  you know they're Christmas on six white boomers it's in Santa Claus now yes all  these kangaroos are these houses that they've got like they're gonna be are  they gonna look to downsize like you kind of think well maybe they'll just  like live out in their massive house and then just give it to their kids what's  the difference but in general they have saved for retirement they're only  spending money down most of them have retired yeah early enough that they've  and potentially with you know new technology and whatnot life goes on  longer you know they need money and they need it somewhere and so the house is  one thing that they could then shift at some point I mean it's true but the  other place they've been encouraged forever to have their money was in bonds  yeah right and like if we destroy if interest rates just march up bonds get  destroyed yeah on a capital basis as they go so how do you fill that gap when  you've potentially got you know this risk of saying like well I've got  somewhere between 10 and 30 years left to live and I don't know which one of  those it is it could be one it could be 30 could be more I don't know I don't  know like plan to run down my money to the last second so where where do I do  it and then you go you know what I'm sat on this massive house that I don't need  anymore because I don't have a family that are here and my kids have got their  house and maybe they give it to the kids and they move into the tiny shoebox that  the kids have been able to afford so they do a swap yeah but it would make  sense that they would look to offload that and downsize if they have that  negative pressure and I think that's the sort of negative pressure you would get  from this and yeah again if that's in a world where the production of maybe it's  better because the production of everything comes cheap maybe boomers have  just played an absolute blinder yeah like we're just about to reduce the cost of  everything to near free and then like score awesome it just like raped society  for the hundred years and given nothing and just yeah taken everything I sound  bitter there well the other is like the I guess the distribution of property  owners as well like I think in Australia it's about a third of people probably  paid off their mortgage a third roughly have mortgages and a third are renters  essentially so you know the third that has paid off their homes probably bought  that back in the early 2000s they're just sitting flush and a lot of home  equity it's the third in the middle I think that's the concerning one where  you potentially have this mean reversion of house pricing but you've still got  interest rates that are really high on mortgages that are really large so your  servicing costs are going up meanwhile your home equity is falling like that's  the kind of bit that would be like really troubling the other bit is like  in this messy transition at the risk of like fearing back full full-blown into  Duma mode yeah but I promise we'll find a way out I always think we cover the  transition in a different episode I think so yeah it's a lot there there is  like a blue-collar white-collar aspect here as well where I've had this  conversation with a few people and they're like oh should I just be going  and like learning a trade and the answer is like maybe I guess like one of the  things I think we'll play out there is like most people default to going oh no  like automations coming for trades as well robotics is coming and I would  almost say in the short term the the risk there is not even robotics it's a  flood of white-collar workers who have been displaced pushing into the trades  at least at entry level and just like flooding the flooding the market with  new supply and that pulls down entry-level apprenticeships and people  doing apprenticeships are free and like that's the that's the bit that I think is  is like of bigger concern in the short to medium term than robotics but  yeah I think you're right in a way if it's the first thing that comes to mind  and it feels like the sort of thing that everybody could do probably the wrong  answer that's right right like going back to the framework of like you know  humans are the qualia then it's like well you know like what's maybe think  about like what's unique about you that you can that not everybody is gonna do  or not everybody's gonna realize but would be valuable and then build the new  thing that's valuable because that's that probably has like at least you can  be the person that if you put that in and you put it in in a way where you're  not using like tons of people and the cost are as low as they're gonna be and  it's just a bunch of AI agents and it's gonna be hard for anybody to compete  you on that if you can get a market so I mean I would generally say go that way  yeah it reminds me of in Rick Rubin's buck the creative acts has been  mentioned a few times having on this podcast it's a great buck yeah like well  and bear in mind this guy's only one the most successful and you know pretty like  best music producers in the entire world and one of his like piece of advice is  like yeah don't listen to the audience I don't even think about them I don't  consider them like you're creating something just like create it for you  until you think it's correct and then let it out into the world yes do whatever  you want with that and it kind of reminds me of this like concept of the  the people as the experiences and the finding the thing to do is like you know  don't like that is something that is more uniquely human I think yeah I think  like the real question that comes up here is why do we choose to work on the  things that we do and it seems to me like some of this should just be  subjective this is channeling your own your own inner drive solving for your  audience of one and yeah it seems to me that the way to enjoy your work is just  to work on something you enjoy and I think that's still gonna serve you in  the future even with AI it's just gonna be a bit easier yeah and permissionless  leverage is the enabling function yeah that will allow you to do that yeah and  some of the the best things in the world are not done because we're talking a lot  about commercial things right like I think this is like it's natural because  AI is a it's a productivity tool technology it's gonna make you more  productive instantly we turn to like what does it do to jobs and like what  does it do to people and their ability to earn money and how should you take  advantage of that and that makes a lot of sense but at the same time like most  of the stuff in the world that we really value and that we consider like to be  truly beautiful or something that's worthwhile is not necessarily something  that was done for commercial purposes yeah and often it's when you take the  commercial out of it and you do something that you you actually produce  something that's worth keeping around in posterity so all the commercial stuff tends to  follow well it may well it's just not commercial at all yeah and then but it's  like a gift to society it's like all of these things like to do any of that you  need time and you need space like you need the concept of leisure right you  know you need the space to consider things and what you want to build in  order to have that impact and then you only get that when you start to remove  the other aspects that you need from your life so if you can eat cheap and  live cheap and do stuff and whether that's done because there's so much  abundance in the world or you've taken those you know choices yourself up front  man yeah that's that's the way completely but I think on the whole like  AI is positive in this sense because it allows us to do those things it will  allow you to make choices yourself that can remove you from this like your debt  system from not your ability to be forced to work on a forced to work a  particular job you can work in different ways you have so much more  optionality than you ever had before in your life you can learn new skills like  I think it's I think that's the positive thing it's about your ability to create  be that in terms of like arts yeah businesses whatever yeah and in that  respect it is like the Renaissance right and that age of economic abundance  frees us to go and pursue those those things that we really want to in a  similar way that patronage did during the Renaissance it's just that at that  time I think they were rediscovering classical knowledge whereas now we can  you know I think we can I think we're probably just recording rediscovering  yeah maybe yeah classical knowledge in a way that you can just do this you can  just do it we're realizing that like oh you can just like be a gentleman scholar  yeah like this ties in nicely to last week's episode the rise of the  generalist because this is the universal person to some degree this is the DaVinci  approach you can you can just go and build knowledge in a bunch of different  disciplines and see where that takes you yeah so your job is to experience life  and to realize where the sharp edges are and to improve them for everybody else  yeah and if you do that you'll probably do very well and if you are doing that  these are excellent tools to help you do it I think that's a pretty good place to  wrap I like that I mean this is just a tribute but I I think that was good  it was maybe pretty good yeah all right I think we wrapped there okay cool that's  the good stuff
