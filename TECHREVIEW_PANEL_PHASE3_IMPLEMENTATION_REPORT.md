2. **Design Document**: Technical architecture and implementation details
3. **Codebase**: Actual implementation code for review

The system combines these inputs into a structured format:

```
PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD):
[PRD content]

TECHNICAL DESIGN DOCUMENT:
[Design doc content]

CODEBASE IMPLEMENTATION:
[Codebase content]
```

### Configuration Updates

Updated `TechReviewConfig` class with:

- **Required Inputs**: `["prd", "designDoc", "codebase"]`
- **Conversation Balance**: `{ conservative: 70, innovation: 30 }`
- **Participant Roles**: Updated to match Phase 3 specifications
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all requirements
